				<h1>Pricing Models</h1>
				<p class="mt-5">We understand that your requirements may vary from project to project. That's why our agile pricing models are tailored to reflect the complexity and maturity of the specifications, technology, process and other factors that drive successful delivery. Choose a model based on your time and cost considerations with our non-linear and agile pricing models:</p>

				<div class="tBox">
					<i class="icon1"></i>
					<h4><strong>Fixed Price</strong></h4>
					<p class="py-3">The billing is done according to a fixed project cost</p>
                    <p>We proceed for the fixed price model when project specification, requirements for web/ mobile development processes, resources & deadlines are clearly defined, technical documentation is already available or properly planned.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
				<div class="tBox">
					<i class="icon2"></i>
					<h4><strong>Retainer</strong></h4>
					<p class="py-3">The billing is done on a periodic basis such as 2-4 weeks</p>
                    <p>We suggest this engagement model when project specification either has insufficient level of details or doesn't exist, development processes and deadlines are not yet clear, documentation is unavailable or incomplete.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
				<div class="tBox">
					<i class="icon3"></i>
					<h4><strong>Hourly</strong></h4>
					<p class="py-3">The billing is done according to the time spent by the team</p>
                    <p>We go for hourly model when only the general idea and project requirements are available. Project specification,requirements for development processes, deadlines and resources are still to be estimated, discussed and negotiated.</p>
